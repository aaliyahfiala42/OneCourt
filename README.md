# OneCourt

The purpose of this repository is to store the object and event detection models for various sports.


### Tennis Key milestones
 - [ ] Train tennis model to track ball location
 - [ ] Train tennis model to track player locations
 - [ ] Train tennis model to track key actions (bounce, hit, air)
 - [ ] Homography estimations for tennis court positions
 - [ ] Train tennis model to track game events (score, out, etc.)
 - [ ] Explore designing a single model architecture to track all of the details that we want to improve inference and scalability
 - [ ] Upload model to server and connect it to the device
 - [ ] Test the complete-end-to-end process with our own generated tennis footage*
 - [ ] Research how to improve homographic projections
 - [ ] Explore ways to improve overall performance and inference
 - [ ] Test process end-to-end in a live tennis match on UW tennis court*
